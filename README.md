# 📊 TSF Internship Task 1 – Supervised Machine Learning  

Welcome to the **TSF Internship Task 1** repository! This project demonstrates **Supervised Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict student scores based on study hours. The analysis is performed using **Python and data science libraries**.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project aims to:  

- 📊 Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on student performance data.  
- 📈 Build and train a **Linear Regression model** to predict student scores.  
- 📉 Evaluate model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.  
- 🎯 Predict student scores for a given number of study hours.  

## 📂 Dataset  

The dataset used in this project contains:  

- 📖 **Study Hours** – Number of hours a student studies per day.  
- 🎯 **Scores** – Student exam scores (percentage).  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `pandas` - for data manipulation  
  - `numpy` - for numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - for data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` - for building the regression model  

## 📜 Notebook Content
